# griddy

griddy is a low-level grid-based CSS framework, inspired by the awesome [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss) and originally built as a capstone project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)'s HTML and CSS course. It's written in [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com).
